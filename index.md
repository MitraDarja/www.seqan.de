# What is SeqAn?

SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures for the analysis of sequences with the
focus on biological data. Our library applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality,
extensibility, and integration with other libraries. SeqAn is easy to use and simplifies the development of new software
tools with a minimal loss of performance.

* DATA STRUCTURES

  SeqAn offers many data structures for sequence analysis. For example a unified interface for searching in string
  indices or succinct data structures for pangenomics.
* ALGORITHMS

  SeqAn offer many core algorithms for sequence analysis. For example, pairwise and multiple alignments, approximate
  string searches and filter algorithms.
* PARALLELIZATION

  SeqAn support modern Hardware. SIMD vectorization and multicore processing are being incorporated in core algorithmic
  components.
* Input and Output

  In times of large sequencing data fast I/O is crucial. Learn about SeqAn I/O modules and supported data formats.
* APPS

  Many efficient applications by different scientific groups and companies are based on SeqAn. Official applications by
  SeqAn project members are presented here and also some third party apps.
* WORKFLOWS

  Often several applications are connected in involved scientific workflows. SeqAn supports easy integration of its applications into workflows.

# Center for Integrative Bioinformatics

SeqAn is partner of the Center for Integrative Bioinformatics (CIBI) in the de.NBI network and offers services for
analysing sequencing data. Our services include the development and maintenance of the SeqAn library, its associated
applications and the build and test infrastructure of them, as well as, training and education by organising regular
developer and user meetings and providing online training materials.
