Head of the group. My research is influenced by the training I received as an algorithmicist at the Max-Planck-Institute
for Computer Science in Saarbrücken, Germany and by my subsequent research as a senior scientist at Celera Genomics in
Rockville, MD, USA. I aim to enable translational research in computationally based life sciences by removing existing
(communication) gaps between theoretical algorithmicists, statisticians, programmers, and users in the biomedical
field.I obtained my Diploma in Computer Science from Saarbrücken University and my PhD from the Max-Planck-Institute for
Computer Science in Saarbrücken.
